RAG Playground is an application that allows you to interact with your PDF files using the Language Model of your choice.

## Introduction
Streamlit application that enables users to upload a pdf file and chat with an LLM for performing document analysis in a playground environment.
Compare the performance of LLMs across endpoint providers to find the best possible configuration for your speed, latency and cost requirements using the dynamic routing feature.
Play intuitively tuning the model hyperparameters as temperature, chunk size, chunk overlap or try the model with/without conversational capabilities.

You find more model/provider information in the [Unify benchmark interface](https://unify.ai/hub).
